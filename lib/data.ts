      "Historic first subnational citizens' climate assembly in Nigeria and Africa, bringing together community voices, climate experts, and policymakers to co-create inclusive climate policies.",
    fullDescription: `
      The Plateau State Climate Assembly (PSCA), inaugurated from June 2–5, 2025, marked a historic milestone as the first subnational citizens' climate assembly in Nigeria and across Africa. This groundbreaking initiative is anchored within the Plateau State Open Government Partnership (OGP) 2025–2027 Action Plan and is spearheaded by the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Mineral Development (MECC&MD), with technical support from Fundlink Aid International.

      PSCA is envisioned as a multi-stakeholder platform that brings together community voices, climate experts, civil society, and policymakers to co-create inclusive and people-centered climate policies and action plans. Through its deliberative format, the Assembly seeks to institutionalize participatory democracy in climate governance, strengthen climate resilience, and advance environmental sustainability across Plateau State.

      The four-day event included:
      • Pre-inauguration strategy planning meeting
      • Hybrid inauguration ceremony with prominent dignitaries
      • Technical sessions and breakout groups
      • Policy validation and action plan development
      • World Environment Day tree planting ceremony
      • Assembly leadership election
      • Closing dinner and certificate presentation

      The Assembly successfully established a novel participatory framework for climate governance in Plateau State, promoting evidence-informed discussions, strengthening citizen engagement, validating state climate policy, and launching the development of the state's action plan and legislative draft.
